      <p className="about-statement">
        I am a full-stack developer specializing in Rust TypeScript and Solana. I build fast reliable systems with clean responsive interfaces and enjoy working where backend logic user experience and blockchain technology intersect.

      <p className="about-statement">
        I entered the crypto and Web3 space in 2023 and have remained deeply involved ever since. I have contributed as a moderator community helper and active participant in research trading and ecosystem discussions. These experiences showed me how projects grow through market cycles how communities form and how belief coordination and timing drive success.

      <br />
      <p className="about-statement">
        Recently I have expanded into content creation. I just started writing content making memes and producing AI videos while also working as a social media manager. This creative side lets me combine technical knowledge with storytelling to engage communities and share insights in a more relatable way.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="about-statement">
        I love solving problems learning fast and constantly improving my craft. My long-term goal is to build tools products and infrastructure that make decentralized technology more accessible useful and open while growing as both a builder and creator in a space that values experimentation innovation and community.
