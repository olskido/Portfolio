      <p className="about-statement">
        I am a full-stack developer who works with Rust, TypeScript, and Solana. I enjoy building systems that run fast, handle real workloads, and connect to clean and responsive interfaces. I like working where backend logic, user experience, and blockchain technology meet, and I care about writing code that is reliable, understandable, and ready for real use.

      <p className="about-statement">
        I joined the crypto and Web3 space in 2023 and have stayed involved ever since. Over time, I have worked with different projects as a moderator, helper, and community contributor. I have seen how new ideas start, how communities form, and how projects try to grow through market cycles. I have also taken part in research, trading, and ecosystem discussions, which helped me understand how tokens, incentives, and user behavior shape the success of a project. These experiences taught me that crypto is not only about technology, but also about belief, coordination, and timing.

      <p className="about-statement">
        My involvement in the space gave me a view of both the technical side and the social side. I have watched hype cycles rise and fade, seen builders continue during slow markets, and learned how real adoption usually takes patience and strong community support. This makes me think more carefully about what I build and why it matters.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="about-statement">
        I enjoy solving problems, learning quickly, and improving my craft. I like breaking complicated systems into smaller parts and making them work in a clear and efficient way. My long-term goal is to contribute to tools, products, and infrastructure that make decentralized technology more useful and open to more people, while also growing as a builder in a community that values experimentation and innovation.
